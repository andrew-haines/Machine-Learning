neural network data preprocessing

- calculate average baseline from 4EG_1_0ppb, 4EG_2_0ppb, 4EP_1_0ppb, 4EP_2_0ppb.

- using ksmoothing to average points over a kernel window

- smooth datapoints so it doesnt sample every 0.5 seconds. observe graph to determine
  interval to smooth over. 
  
- observe which sensors react to 4EG and 4EP presence respectively.
	- both react to T70/2, T30/1, PA2 only really. 
	- 4EG starts with a negative impact on these sensors, rises, and then decreases
	- 4EP starts by a positive impact on these sensors and then naturally decays.
  
- determine if any sensors simply dont react to the presence of these analytes in callibration set

- Remove these features if this is the case

- subtract smoothed baseline from all smoothed training sets and callibration sets.

- combine processed training and callibration sets

- The result will be input to the NN

neural network process

- perform whitening on input to remove correlation between features resulting in new feature space

- check if any of the new features can be pruned

- send resultant feature space to RBF for training

- check performance using K fold cross validation of training set to test set

- once confident in the model, process the prediction set to get 4EG, 4EP quantities
